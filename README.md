Girasoles Record Keeping System.pdf is the original notes from Ben.

HBI_EMR_Data.xlsx is sample data from the existing system.

HBI_MockupsV2.pdf are the mockups of some initial pages.

schema.txt is the current database schema.  We'd like to achive three things:
1) Reorganize it to match the desired forms & actual information that we want to capture.
2) Create english names for the fields.
3. Create spanish translations for the display.
